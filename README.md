# switchmap

An independent SwitchMap, inspired by RxJs, for Nodejs and Javascript.

> About a year ago I wrote one of these in a Javascript codebase for the day job; but I've been jonesing for something similar in the open-source community, so I decided to write another - this time in Typescript. I hope it is useful to others.
