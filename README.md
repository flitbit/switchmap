# switchmap

An independent SwitchMap, inspired by RxJs, for Nodejs and Javascript.

> About a year ago I wrote one of these in Javascript in a codebase I no longer have access to, but I've been jonesing for it, so I decided to write another, clean room implementation in Typescript. I hope it is useful to others.
